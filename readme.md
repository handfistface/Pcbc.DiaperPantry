AidaForm.com is the site we plan to use to ingest the orders
[This is the site](https://my.aidaform.com/)

I have this linked up to automatically drop the results into a spreadsheet in my google drive
The spreadsheet is titled "New Child Form" for the "Diaper Pantry Child Form" on aidaform

## TODO
+ Ingest the Adult Registration Form
+ Drop results from the google sheet into a database
+ Make a UI program that can allow Judy to type up a formatted email and bulk send them to all the people who have recently visited the diaper pantry
